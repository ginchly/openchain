Yet companies and governments are seizing land and evicting families to grow crops for export.  The Behind the Brands Scorecard looks at whether the big food companies say they do the right thing by the land and the communities who live on it, and have policies in place to deal with suppliers who violate land rights.</div></div>

On average, women account for around 43% of the agricultural labor force in the developing world but face a myriad of obstacles including limited power over decision-making, access to finance, land, and control of  resources. So the Behind the Brands Scorecard looks at what the Big Ten companies say they are doing to fight discrimination and to make sure women get a fair deal now and in the future.</div></div>

The Behind the Brands Scorecard examines what the world’s biggest companies say they are doing to support the world’s food producers to become resilient and successful.</div></div>

So the Behind the Brands Scorecard examines what companies say they are doing to ensure the rights of farm workers, including by tackling low pay, poor and unsafe working conditions, and child exploitation.</div></div>

The Behind the Brands Scorecard assesses how committed companies are to disclosing where they source their products and raw materials and under what conditions, as well as examining their lobbying practices, tax disclosure and how they enforce their requirements on suppliers.</div></div>

So the Behind the Brands Scorecard looks at what the Big Ten companies say they are doing to disclose and reduce their water use, and to manage water sustainably and responsibly in areas where it is already in short supply. We also assess whether companies require consultation with communities on water use and recognize the responsibility to respect communities’ water rights.</div></div>
